## **3. Design**

This section discusses the current design pattern used by TrackPad. It explains the current architecture of TrackPad. 
Then, there is a more in depth explanation on the design of the Ui, model and storage functionality. 

### 3.1 Architecture

<span style="display:block;align:center">![Architecture Class Diagram](images/devguideimages/ArchitectureDiagram.png)</span>
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 1 Architecture Class Diagram</i></sup></div><br>

Figure 1 explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#36-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#32-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#33-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#34-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#35-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/devguideimages/LogicClassDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 2 Class Diagram of the Logic Component</i></sup></div><br>

For example, the `Logic` component (seen from Figure 2 above) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

![Sequence Diagram of the Various Components](images/devguideimages/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 3 Sequence Diagram of the various components</i></sup></div><br>

Figure 3 above shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-attraction 1`.

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 3.2 UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/devguideimages/UiClassDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 4 Structure of the Ui Component, Ui Class Diagram</i></sup></div><br>

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `AttractionListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

This design is similar to the Architectural design of TrackPad, whereby different UiParts are encapsulated in the MainWindow java controller class. This allows the Logic to minimise interaction with the UI, since the MainWindow manages the changes to any UiPart classes that result from the execution in the Logic component.

### 3.3 Logic

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/devguideimages/LogicClassDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 5 Structure of the Logic Component, Logic Class Diagram</i></sup></div><br>

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` in Figure 5 receives the user command.
1. It uses the `TrackPadParser` class to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an attraction).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete-attraction 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete-attraction 1` Command](images/devguideimages/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 6 Interactions inside the Logic Component for the `delete-attraction 1` Command</i></sup></div><br>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### 3.4 Model

![Structure of the Model Component](images/devguideimages/ModelClassDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 7 Structure of the Model Component, Model Class Diagram</i></sup></div><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model` component shown in Figure 7,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores an `AttractionList` object that is a list of all the attractions in TrackPad.
* stores an `ItineraryList` object that is a list of all the itineraries in TrackPad.
* stores an `ItineraryAttractionList` object that is a list of all the attractions in the current selected itinerary.
* exposes two unmodifiable `ObservableList<Attraction>` and `ObservableList<Itinerary>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to the lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

< markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 
An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `TrackPad`, which `Attraction` references. This allows `TrackPad` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Attraction` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 8 Structure of an alternative Model Component, Alternative Model Class Diagram</i></sup></div></div><br>

### 3.5 Storage

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/devguideimages/StorageClassDiagram.png)
<div align="center"><sup style="font-size:100%"><i>Figure 9 Structure of the Storage Component, Storage Class Diagram</i></sup></div><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component shown in Figure 9,
* saves `UserPref` objects containing user preferences in json format and read it back.
* saves `AttractionList` objects containing attraction data in json format and read it back.
* saves `ItineraryList` objects containing itinerary data in json format and read it back.

### 3.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **4. Implementation**
This section describes some noteworthy details on the implementation of core TrackPad feature.

*To be added*

### 3.ia Itinerary Attraction class
This is a type of `Attraction` that goes into the `List<Day>` that resides in `Itinerary`. 

#### 3.ia.1 Current Implementation

`ItineraryAttraction` extends `Attraction`. It is a `Attraction` with 2 extra fields, `startTime` and `endTime`. 
It is stored internally as an `List<Day>`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.


#### 3.1.2 Design consideration

##### 3.1.2.1 Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Extends `Attraction`.
  * Pros: Access to private fields in 
  * Cons: Hard to implement and May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Use a wrapper class to contain `Attraction`
`ItineraryAttraction` would contain a field `Attraction` inside.
  * Pros: Easy to implement. No coupling with `Attraction`. 
  * Cons: Does not have access to private fields in attraction, would require 

<!--
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 3.1 \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature


#### 3.1.1 Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedTrackPad`. It extends `TrackPad` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `trackPadStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedTrackPad#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current TrackPad state in its history.
* `VersionedTrackPad#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous TrackPad state from its history.
* `VersionedTrackPad#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone TrackPad state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitTrackPad()`, `Model#undoTrackPad()` and `Model#redoTrackPad()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedTrackPad` will be initialized with the initial TrackPad state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single TrackPad state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th attraction in the TrackPad. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitTrackPad()`, causing the modified state of the TrackPad after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `trackPadStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted TrackPad state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new attraction. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitTrackPad()`, causing another modified TrackPad state to be saved into the `trackPadStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitTrackPad()`, so the TrackPad state will not be saved into the `trackPadStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the attraction was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoTrackPad()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous TrackPad state, and restores the TrackPad to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial TrackPad state, then there are no previous TrackPad states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoTrackPad()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoTrackPad()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the TrackPad to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `trackPadStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest TrackPad state, then there are no undone TrackPad states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoTrackPad()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the TrackPad, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitTrackPad()`, `Model#undoTrackPad()` or `Model#redoTrackPad()`. Thus, the `trackPadStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitTrackPad()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `trackPadStateList`, all TrackPad states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### 3.1.2 Design consideration

##### 3.1.2.1 Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire TrackPad.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the attraction being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix G: Effort**

Our project was harder than Address Book Level 3(AB3) because while AB3 deals with one entity, TrackPad deals with several
entities, including Attractions, Itineraries as well as Itinerary Attraction. Initially, we had to refactor most of the code, 
to change all instance of Person to Attraction and AddressBook to TrackPad. We also had to change the test cases, and figure out
why some of them failed.

After which, we had to implement itinerary into the app, and make it work similarly to Attraction, but taking in different
fields from Attraction. We also had to create new parsers for Itinerary, so that it can read the itinerary commands. 

In addition, we had to implement an adaptable UI, so that the attraction and itinerary box displays will vary in height, 
since we have optional fields for our entities. We had to create different FXML files, to be compatible with our AttractionCard
and ItineraryCard having multiple Labels.

Also, since we stored attractions as a List of Days in itineraries, it proved a further challenge in reading the itinerary
attractions since we had to go through several layers to reach the list of itinerary attractions. Our UI also contains of 
boxes for the Day, to distinguish between different days of the same itinerary.
