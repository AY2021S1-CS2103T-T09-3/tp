## Project: TrackPad

TrackPad is a desktop application for planning trips and tracking tourist attractions. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

  * What it does: Make the graphical user interface more appealing to our users.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the first look of our app can influence the users' decision to use our app or not.
  * Highlights: Work done for this feature includes color and background selection, making borders to have rounded corners and inserting icons for the fields of attractions.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*
