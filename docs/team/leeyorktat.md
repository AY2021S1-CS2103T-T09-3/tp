## Project: TrackPad

TrackPad is a clean and simple desktop application for tracking past itineraries and creating future ones. It is written and compiled in java, hence it's available on all platforms. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to select, edit, find, list itineraries.
  * What it does: allows the user to create itineraries to plan their trips.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can do more than adding attractions and can now plan trips.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()
