## Project: TrackPad

TrackPad is a clean and simple itinerary planning app, with a preloaded database for Rediscover Singapore Attractions. 
It is written and compiled in java, hence it's available on all platforms. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added SelectItinerary, EditItinerary, FindItinerary, ListItinerary command
  * What it does: Allows the user to select an itinerary to perform ItineraryAttraction commands as well as edit, find and list their itineraries.
  * Justification: The SelectItinerary feature is important and expected to be used a lot as it has to be used before any ItineraryAttraction command. The rest of the commands also allow
  the user to perform edit, find and list commands for their itineraries.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of how `Itinerary` and `ItineraryList` classes work.
